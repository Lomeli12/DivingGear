<popupText>Protection from the deep blue.</popupText>
<longText>Using the Vis Tank discovered earlier, you've possibly found a way to stay underwater indefinitely</longText>
<page type="text">As a human, you are limited to the amount of time under the sea. Even with special gear, the ocean is a vile mistress. However, the aura nodes around you can protect you from her anger. With the Aqualis Helm, at the cost of adding flux to the enviroment, you will become sea creature yourself, untouched by natures cruel wrath.</page>

<project id="VISTANK">
<name>Vis Tank</name>
<popupText>Allows items to store Vis.</popupText>
<longText>You may have discovered a way to turn nearby aura into breathable air.</longText>
<page type="text">One location that is not kind to humans is the ocean. Luckily, like anywhere in the world, the ocean has Aura that one can used to survive out in the blue. Vis Tanks are simply a piece of equipment that, when used correctly, will allow one to breath in Aura as air and breath out water as Flux.

However, it is still just a piece of equipment. To take advantage of it, you'll need a bit more.</page>
