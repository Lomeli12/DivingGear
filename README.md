DivingGear
==========

Adds some diving gear for a better aquatic play in Minecraft. Now with Thaumcraft support!

- I don't plan on adding fish due to the number of mods that already do this.

## Planned features

- Different types of coral to spawn underwater
- Buildcraft compatibility(will add a machine that will pump air to the player, but player must stay close to it. Relatively stable air source)
- Full diving suits with Aqua Affinity built in
- Replaceable air tanks for Scuba gear
- Coral based tools
