* I don't plan on adding fish due to the number of mods that already do this.

## Planned features

* Different types of coral to spawn underwater
* Buildcraft compatibility(will add a machine that will pump air to the player, but player must stay close to it. Relatively stable air source)
* Full diving suits with Aqua Affinity built in
* Replaceable air tanks for Scuba gear
* Coral based tools
